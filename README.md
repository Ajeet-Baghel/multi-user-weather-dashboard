🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend


Next.js


React.js


Tailwind CSS


Backend


Node.js


Express.js


Database


MongoDB with Mongoose


Authentication


JWT Bearer Tokens


bcrypt Password Hashing


Weather API


Open-Meteo Geocoding API


Open-Meteo Forecast API


AI Integration


LangChain


OpenAI API


Deterministic Fallback Insight Engine



✨ Core Functionalities
🔐 Authentication System


User Registration


User Login


Session Restoration


Secure Logout


Protected Routes using JWT


Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage.

🌍 Weather Dashboard
Users can:


Add multiple cities


View live weather data


Check short forecasts


Save favorite cities


Monitor weather conditions dynamically



🤖 AI Weather Planner
The AI planner analyzes saved weather data and provides:


Weather summaries


Travel/outdoor suggestions


Rain risk alerts


Warmest city recommendations


If OPENAI_API_KEY is unavailable, the system automatically switches to a fallback planner so the feature always works.

🔒 Authorization & Data Isolation
Every city query is scoped using:
req.user._id
This ensures users can only access their own weather dashboard data.
Even if a user guesses another city ID, they cannot access unauthorized records.

⚙️ Local Setup
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-user-weather-dashboard.git

2️⃣ Backend Setup
Navigate to backend:
cd backend
Install dependencies:
npm install
Create .env file:
PORT=5000MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_stringJWT_SECRET=your_secret_keyOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_keyCLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
Run backend server:
npm run dev
Backend runs on:
http://localhost:5000

3️⃣ Frontend Setup
Navigate to frontend:
cd frontend
Install dependencies:
npm install
Create .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
Run frontend:
npm run dev
Frontend runs on:
http://localhost:3000

🧠 Backend Architecture
The backend follows a modular architecture:
📂 routes/
Defines API endpoints and request routes.
📂 controllers/
Handles request logic and responses.
📂 models/
Defines MongoDB schemas and database models.
📂 middleware/
Contains JWT authentication middleware.
📂 services/
Handles weather API integration and AI planner logic.
